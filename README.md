## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Installing via Smithery (Recommended)

To install Coderide MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@PixdataOrg/coderide):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @PixdataOrg/coderide --client claude
```

### Smithery Deployment Modes

CodeRide MCP supports **dual-mode operation** for both development and production use:

#### üîß **Development/Testing Mode (Mock)**
Perfect for exploring features, testing integrations, or contributing to the project without needing a real CodeRide account.

**How to activate:** In the Smithery playground or configuration, either:
- Leave the `CODERIDE_API_KEY` field empty
- Provide any placeholder value (e.g., `mock-key`, `test`, etc.)

**What you get:**
- All 9 tools available with realistic mock data
- Sample projects (ABC, XYZ) and tasks (ABC-1, ABC-2, etc.)
- Full MCP functionality for testing and development
- No real API calls - completely safe for experimentation

#### üöÄ **Production Mode (Real API)**
For actual CodeRide users who want to integrate with their real projects and tasks.

**How to activate:** Provide a valid CodeRide API key that starts with `CR_API_KEY_`

**What you get:**
- Full integration with your CodeRide workspace
- Real project and task data
- Ability to update tasks and projects
- Complete workflow automation

### Traditional MCP Configuration

For non-Smithery deployments, add this configuration to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coderide": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@coderide/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CODERIDE_API_KEY": "YOUR_CODERIDE_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed.
2.  **CodeRide Account & API Key (Production only):** For production use, you'll need an active CodeRide account and API key from [app.coderide.ai](https://app.coderide.ai).

Once configured, your MCP client will automatically connect to the CodeRide MCP server with the appropriate mode based on your configuration.

## ü§ñ Who is this for?

CodeRide MCP is for:

*   **Developers using AI coding assistants:** Integrate your AI tools (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, etc.) deeply with your CodeRide task management.
*   **Teams adopting AI-driven development:** Standardize how AI agents access project information and contribute to tasks.
*   **Anyone building with MCP:** Leverage a powerful example of an MCP server that connects to a real-world SaaS platform.

If you're looking to make your AI assistant a more productive and integrated member of your development team, CodeRide MCP is for you.
